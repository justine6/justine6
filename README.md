## 🌐 Overview  

This project demonstrates:  

* Full-stack deployment with **Next.js** on **Vercel**  
* Custom domain integration (`jutellane.com`)  
* Professional-grade **email setup** (`info@jutellane.com`)  
* Modular, responsive **landing page design**  
* Automated docs + strict/soft validation workflows  

---

## 🔐 Security & Configuration  

⚠️ Sensitive credentials and logic are fully abstracted.  

* `.env.local`, auth keys, and DNS configs are excluded via `.gitignore`.  
* Deployment targets (Vercel, DNS, etc.) are managed privately.  

---

## 📚 Documentation  

📖 Docs are in `/docs`, with automatic publishing to **GitHub Pages**.  

Highlights:  
- Dictionary validation workflow (soft vs strict enforcement).  
- Branching rules (`develop` = soft, `main` = strict).  
- CI/CD automation with PowerShell + Node.js.  

---

## 🚦 Workflows in Action  

The **Nouvo Ayiti 2075 Blogs repo** introduced a two-tier validation approach now also adopted here:  

- 🟢 **Soft Validation** → runs on `develop` branch (logs missing keys but passes build).  
- 🔴 **Strict Validation** → runs on `main` branch (fails build if any keys are missing).

![Strict Workflow](https://github.com/justine6/nouvo-ayiti-2075-blogs/actions/workflows/check-dicts-strict.yml/badge.svg)
